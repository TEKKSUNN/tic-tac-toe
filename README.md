# Author's Experience
- WOW! I LITERALLY JUST FINISHED JAVASCRIPT BACKEND, AND IT TOOK ME 3 DAYS JUST TO COMPLETE, I NEED TO DO HTML AND CSS NOW, AND THEN ALSO DO JAVASCRIPT AGAIN AFTER THAT. JUST WOW.
- The day after the previous note - I HAVE NO IDEA WTF I'M READING, MY JAVASCRIPT IS A COMPLETE CHAOS, I HAVEN'T PUSHED THE CHANGES YET BECAUSE OF HOW MANY BUGS APPEAR. BUT TRUST ME, THE JAVASCRIPT IS COMPLEX AND SOMETIMES I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M READING.
