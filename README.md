# tic-tac-toe
For The Odin Project's "Project: Tic Tac Toe" from "Javascript"

# Author's Experience
- WOW! I LITERALLY JUST FINISHED JAVASCRIPT BACKEND, AND IT TOOK ME 3 DAYS JUST TO COMPLETE, I NEED TO DO HTML AND CSS NOW, AND THEN ALSO DO JAVASCRIPT AGAIN AFTER THAT. JUST WOW.
- The day after the previous note - I HAVE NO IDEA WTF I'M READING, MY JAVASCRIPT IS A COMPLETE CHAOS, I HAVEN'T PUSHED THE CHANGES YET BECAUSE OF HOW MANY BUGS APPEAR. BUT TRUST ME, THE JAVASCRIPT IS COMPLEX AND SOMETIMES I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M READING.

## Completion of Project
Finally... I finished this project. It took me almost a week to finish this bullshit. I'm finally free at last. I can finally move on to the next lessons... I'm not gonna touch this repo again, because the code is too messy to understand. I can go and make new tic tac toe again, but I will never touch the javascript of this code, ever.
